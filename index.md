## Work Experience
* **MokaHR Company**  
    *December 2018 - April 2019*  
    Algorithmic Intern, AI Group
    * Combined CTPN and CRNN and developed model to solve resume OCR problems (CN & EN) in TensorFlow
and simplified Network Structure and sped up inference time 2s/10s on average, within losing 2% accuracy
    * Adapted open source labeling software to mark text and run evaluation and unit test for different stages 
    * Packaged model into web service using gunicorn and Flask, provided API and deployed on Alibaba cloud
    * Implemented cache mechanism with Redis and multistage recognition with high accuracy (over 90% per label)
and improved 15% overall performance and about 200% QPS than the original third-party service with parallel processing in Python
* **Beijing Infervision Company**  
    *January 2018 - May 2018*
    Algorithmic Intern, Modeling Group
    * Used and adjusted YOLOV2 and YOLOV3 under darknet frame and FPN under mxnet for illness detection
on DR images
    * Calculated anchor size and number in different methods for YOLO and combined three detection layers to
improve accuracy by 5% roughly on tiny objects
    * Utilized Focal Loss to replace original softmax function to care about cases with fewer samples and increase
average accuracy by about 3%

## Projects

* **HDR (High Dynamical Range)  Video Recovering Algorithm**  
    *August 2018 - December 2018*   
    Company Sponsor: OTC/SSG/Intel; Company Mentor: Zhao Juan, Intel; Academic Advisor: Long Yong  
    [Report Link](doc/resource/VE450_Report_Team15.pdf)
    * Used hdrcnn model to train data to transform LDR to HDR, with different data enhancements and loss
functions, eg, cosine loss, in order to reconstructed over exposed area and restored details in dark area
    * Evaluated model performance using HDR-VDP v2 and obtained 20/100 more than traditional mathematical
method
    * Applied FFmpeg, OpenEXR to finish the transfer from LDR video to image and image to HDR video, and
added meta data of HDR10 format and corresponding BT2020 curves
